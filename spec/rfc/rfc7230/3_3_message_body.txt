RFC 7230

3.3. Message Body

The message body (if any) of an HTTP message is used to carry the
payload body of that request or response. The message body is
identical to the payload body unless a transfer coding has been
applied, as described in Section 3.3.1.

    message-body = *OCTET
    
The rules for when a message body is allowed in a message differ for
requests and responses.

The presence of a message body in a request is signaled by a
Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field. Request message
framing is independent of method semantics, even if the method does
not define any use for a message body.

The presence of a message body in a response depends on both the
request method to which it is responding and the response status code
(Section 3.1.2). Responses to the HEAD request method (Section 4.3.2
of [RFC7231]) never include a message body because the associated
response header fields (e.g., Transfer-Encoding, Content-Length,
etc.), if present, indicate only what their values would have been if
the request method had been GET (Section 4.3.1 of [RFC7231]). 2xx
(Successful) responses to a CONNECT request method (Section 4.3.6 of
[RFC7231]) switch to tunnel mode instead of having a message body.
All 1xx (Informational), 204 (No Content), and 304 (Not Modified)
responses do not include a message body. All other responses do
include a message body, although the body might be of zero length.
